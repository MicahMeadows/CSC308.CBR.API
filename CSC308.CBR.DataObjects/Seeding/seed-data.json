We want to make sure as professors that we're setting the students up for success. And I think we do this in a number of different ways. The first is our small classroom size. Students are able to interract with their professors and learn about different internship opportunities, careers, different fields they can go into after they graduate with a Business degree at EKU. \r\n\r\nOne of the major benefits about the College of Business is we've got a wide variety of different concentrations. With 50% of all college graduates going into the field of sales, this provides them an opportunity to have that foundation of personal selling, marketing principles, sales management, and other sales-related courses to be successful in that commission-based role.\r\n\r\nThe PGA Golf Management Program is a very unique program. There's only 18 PGA accredited universities in the country that are accredited by the PGA of America. And we're very fortunate to have our program here at Eastern Kentucky University. Students are earning a Bachelor's of Business Administration with a concentration in PGA Golf Management. \r\n\r\nStudents in our program they go on to run a golf operation in the sense of being a PGA Head Professional, Assistant Professional or General Manager. They can also do a lot of other things which involve club repair, tournament operations, teaching, coaching, so there's a lot of different career aspects. \r\n\r\nThere's so many things that EKU has to offer, and I believe getting involved on campus is a great way to meet new people, but also expand your network as well as a student."

It is one of the last schools like that in the state and it's on our campus so I didn't have to worry about driving to it or anything like that. And it was just something super special to me that really drew me here to Eastern.\r\n\r\nThe ASLIE program is one of the top-notch programs in the US. We are fully accredited, and we offer various resources for the students and helping them acquire their language skills to serve the deaf community. For example, the \"LLC\" the Living Learning Community, which means that the students live on one given floor in the dorm and only use ASL for communication purposes. So that's different than other universities. We also offer a study abroad program. And we have traveled to Spain and various countries for study abroad. And then we are interacting with the deaf community and students there.\r\n\r\nI definitely feel that the education program here has prepared me for my post-graduation plans. We've had a lot of hands-on experience as we go into the job field, the many projects, many extensive lesson plans, and all of that is just building everything up. If you're looking for a hands on experience that you know that you're going to love getting involved with students learning how to write lesson plans, and having the faculty to support you. That is what you're going to find here at Eastern Kentucky University."

I think it's very important that the college offers the mental health services for students. When someone is suffering with a lot of symptoms of depression, of anxiety, and that's going to impact their academics too. And when someone is feeling at their best, when somebody has the mental resources to devote to their academics, they're going to do better, they're going to absorb more. \r\n\r\nThe faculty are more than willing to help all students be successful.

As an Aviation major, it's gearing me toward being a Professional Pilot, the Aviation program here at Eastern Kentucky is, is really great. There's a lot of people who are driven like that is their passion. A lot of former pilots themselves teaching you, and they want to see you succeed. It's nice because it is a Part 141 operation. So instead of having to get 1,500 hours, before I'd be able to fly for an airline, I would be able to get hired at 1,000. And you leave with a restricted ATP.\r\n\r\nSTEM is really used in just about every career somebody would want to obtain. You have to have skills in math to do just about any career out there... Also in science. So we help to prepare students by giving them skills in the laboratory, as well in math in order to succeed. \r\n\r\nFaculty at EKU are very dedicated to student success. I think one of the reasons why is we see that passion for students to get an education to want to learn more to increase their knowledge base, and their passion actually ignites our passion in order to provide a more enhanced experience. And in doing that, we can work with students in the classroom, trying to really engage them to learn more about specific content, and also in a research laboratory setting. \r\n\r\nOne of the crown jewels in EKU is our Forensic Science program. We offer Forensic Biology and Forensic Chemistry. Both are accredited by FEPAC, which is the crediting body a forensic science programs and having two programs actually accredited by FEPAC is a significant feat.\r\n\r\nThe affordability definitely drew me in because of its affordability EKU has granted me the opportunity to to get my writings and pursue a career that I want to."

The African and African American Studies program trains students to function in a world that is becoming increasingly multicultural, increasingly diverse. It's important for you to have the skills, the tools to be able to deal with people who are different from you. People who speak a different language, have different culture, and different ways of perceiving life. \r\n\r\nThese courses that students do in FFA, will provide them with a foundational knowledge about the contributions made by black people to human civilization. So it increases your global perspective. We're essentially training global citizens, and you have a group of faculty who are dedicated to the success of students who go out of their way to mentor students, both in the classroom and outside the classroom. \r\n\r\nAnd that is what I find very unique about EKU -- the willingness of the instructors to go extra mile and these are instructors from different cultural backgrounds, different countries with different ideologies, different ethnicities. So when you come to EKU, you're gonna get world-class education provided by world class instructors from different countries."

We like to say that public health -- while we're in the health field -- we try and keep people healthy, so they don't have to go to the nurse or to the doctor. We are all about educating people on how to stay healthy or get healthy. We are the epidemiologists who are tracking disease and figuring out how cases are being spread. We do a little bit of everything. That's kind of the beauty of public health.\r\n\r\nThe quality of education is excellent. I have some of the best professors and they really care about us. They will notice if doesn't seem like we're doing all right, and they'll come up to us and ask us, \"What's going on? Is there anything I can help you with?\" And if you just have a lot on your plate, if you talk to them, they are always there for you. I really have enjoyed being a part of this program."

So that's beyond just Kentucky. But in the multistate region, we have really tremendous programs speaking to almost every aspect of public safety, criminal justice, fire science, corrections, social justice, and then recently, we added military science to the ROTC program as part of our college as well. \r\n\r\nI think we really understand the challenges that veterans face, we're able to help them really get the most out of the benefits, we're able to be flexible with their schedules, we understand what it means to deploy and have the service obligations because most of the faculty in our college come from a public safety service or military background.\r\n\r\nI didn't start out as a Criminal Justice major. So that was a big change. For me. I was worried, but it was honestly the best experience. Since I came into the college, everybody welcomed me with open arms. And everything was explained to me in great detail. And it was a very welcoming environment. And it has been for the past three years.\r\n\r\nReally the most valuable education is the combination of theory and practice. Employers who are looking for people like paramedics, police officers, federal agents, are looking for people who really know how to do the actual tasks, but also understand why they're doing them. And all of our programs in the college really bring those two together. So when our students graduate, they're seen as being experienced, they've already been doing the things that they've been learning about, and they don't need such a steep learning curve to transition to the workplace. And employers really seem to like that.\r\n\r\nI feel like the quality of education that I've received here has been phenomenal. I think that comes from a lot of the professors and their willingness to not only help you but their drive to want to see you succeed as much as you want to see yourself succeed. Any problem I've ever had a professor has been more than willing to do whatever I need for my own success but also as a successful individual after college too."

We want it to be a total campus experience, a total student experience. And so I think that you'll find that our students come out strong in full force. Our experience is very much where our fan base our students are the team behind the teams, and from the light shows, to the promos to the giveaways, everything that we do is tailored with those fans in mind. \r\n\r\nWe don't have a dedicated athletics fee, you know, they're paying their tuition fees otherwise, but those give them credit that they can come into our games for free, as long as they're presenting a valid student ID that we can scan. Tailgating is really an extension of our games. What happens on the parking lots before games and what happens, you know, in the ravine, or what happens at that Pal Plaza, you know, all of those things are a direct part of of the type of environment type of experience that we try to create. And we know it's engaging for students andengaging for our community, and just a lot of fun, it adds to that campus experience. \r\n\r\nWe want to be better tomorrow than we are today. We're certainly very proud of the history of success of so many of the traditions that we enjoy here. Hopefully a student-athlete who wants to come here who wants to leave a place better than they found it who wants to grow alongside an Athletics department, the programs that make it up the people that make it up. I think this is an outstanding place. We are committed to competing at the highest level of Division I and you know, being that point of pride for our community and our campus."

So many different industries, so many different sectors talk about how they can change your life with a product or service. We have the great benefit here at this institution to be able to do that for students every day. Over 60% of our students are either a low income student or a first in their family to go to college. So we are good at helping students get from where they are, to where they want to be.\r\n\r\nI think EKU to me, means community and a home away from home. I have a dad, he's an alumni of Eastern so coming to Eastern felt like a natural choice, but initially, I was a little homesick. But I found that there was so much community here and so many people that were really invested in my journey. And it made it really easy for me to want to be here and it truly started to feel like a home away from home. It really felt like a community and a place where I was wanted and belonged and it's ended up being probably like the highlight of my life as far as college.\r\n\r\nWe're centrally located in the US. We're about an hour from from Cincinnati from Louisville. We're close to communities like Lexington, Knoxville... And there's also so much natural beauty here as we are around a lot of the most beautiful parts of the US.\r\n\r\nRichmond itself has so much community, there's the campus life, which is amazing. And I spent a lot of my time at the ravine and the library. I mean, the campus is just absolutely gorgeous. And there's so many different places that you can go and study and be with your friends. I've been able to find like a community here in Richmond that I know I'll get to keep after I graduate.\r\n\r\nThere's no place else where you're going to find a an institution, a family of people who are going to say, \"We want you to be a part of our community. To be a part of our family. And once you become a Colonel, you're a Colonel for life.\" While we're going to help you here in the classroom, get an amazing world class education, we're going to help you find that first job, that second job, that third job... So many people are going to build into your success, that there's no way that you can't achieve all of your hopes and dreams."

At each of our front desk, we have what we call a \"Community Receptionist.\" Anytime somebody comes in, there's always someone there with like warm welcome smile, I'm able to like introduce themselves or if they have any questions or problems. On every floor, there's a Resident Advisor. So they are there as the person who checks in with your students on a pretty regular basis, whether that's week to week, day to day, it depends and they put on programs that are interest-based for them to really create the environment that like -- this is somewhere they belong to, this is somewhere they can go. When you live on campus, your commute is less than five minutes, a lot of times. And so a lot of students when you take those ATMs, it's super nice. If you're running late, you're right next door. Or if you're it's cold outside and you want to go get food or something in the cafeteria, we have plenty of options on campus for that as well. And it's never too far. \r\n\r\nWe have about 15 Living Learning Communities give or take. They are placed in a very specific location. So for instance, we have an American Sign Language Living Learning Community, which is in Walters Hall. Students are able to sign and that's like a major slash interest-based one. Versus we have Honors Living Learning Community, which is in Martin Hall, as well as Burnham, that one is in two different halls. And so it's an opportunity for students to be able to like, make friends and be in a selective almost organization. So they have additional programming, additional resources for them to be able to get to know one another and do something that they find interesting. \r\n\r\nI would say mostly like living on campus provides an amazing opportunity to get to meet people because at the end of the day, you're all living together. And you all just have a camaraderie of being able to go through something that other people aren't necessarily going through at the time and you all live in the same hall, and so you know what it's like. You also have the opportunity to live near people who have the same classes as you and so you're able to provide a lot easier study groups, homework help, things like that, or you're able to interact with upperclassmen who have gone through college, so if you have any questions or anything that you can ask somebody who's been through this. It provides a whole lot more additional support that you may not be able to get if you live off-campus.\r\n\r\n"

Telfer Hall residents have semi-suite style living where each resident shares a bedroom with one other resident and a bathroom with their roommate and two other students. Residents in this hall can control personal thermostats, which allow for greater comfort throughout the year. Residents also have access to multiple kitchens within the residence hall, a study lounge on each floor, and patios which are great for sitting outdoors with friends and suitemates.</p><p>&nbsp;</p>"

We have Home Zone, which is your traditional kind of meat and potatoes, things that people are used to having at home. There's a grill which we're really proud of because it does feature EKU Meadowbrook farmed beef. So all the hamburger patties there are from our university farm. \r\n\r\nWe also have the retail space, which is in lowercase that ranges anywhere from Moe's, Panda Express, Chik-fil-A -- we offer as many options as possible to as many students so that there is excitement and that it's a changing dining experience that also serves our students who are vegan or vegetarian-only giving them more options for protein besides your typical tofu and other things like that.\r\n\r\nColonel Cupboard is our on-campus food pantry. We provide free food and toiletry items for students who are on campus that are in need of those resources. There is a huge need for food pantries and clothing banks on campus. In our survey of college students, it was shown that 1 in 3 students do face low food insecurity. \r\n\r\nI think mental health is something that is really important for us to consistently keep in mind. When students are feeling well physically and mentally, that will translate into them performing better academically. So when we are able to provide students with food options or clothing that they feel comfortable in, that puts them in a better mental headspace. Kind of something they don't have to worry about knowing that this is a resource they can utilize. And then that focus is able to go back on their academics and getting good grades and achieving their goals.\r\n\r\n"

A lot of times we think about recreation centers, it's all about kind of working out. I think one thing we've done is we've really created a hub whether it's thinking about eSports or gaming, whether it's think about climbing the rock wall, but it's become a place where students like to gather but there's there's also an element of fitness miss just a great opportunity for our students to just keep connected.</p><p>There are so many things that students can do at the Rec Center to stay active. I personally use it almost every single day. My favorite thing about the Rec Center is the rock climbing wall, I actually ended up joining a rock climbing club, which is something I never thought I would do. But it's been like one of my favorite parts of like every Tuesday night and a tradition that me and my friends have created. So, I just really liked that the Rec Center has always given me new opportunities and new ideas and ways to stay active. And if I can't think of any on my own, there's always a great staff there to help us like find new things to do.</p><p>Our first big thing for our new students is \"Biggie Welcome.\" Once they come to campus, that's how we kick the school year off in the fall for those students. It's a great way for them to connect with their peers. They also have an upper class leader that helps guide their group around throughout that experience. And they help them form connections and bonds to the other new students. There's a variety of activities and events during that time for students to have fun, but also learn a bit more about themselves and about campus.</p><p>There are so many opportunities for students from different backgrounds to engage here in the community at Eastern. I think that that's something that I noticed about Eastern that was different than other schools is the emphasis that they put on making sure that everyone has a place and that there's somewhere for everyone to feel comfortable. I found a lot of community in the clubs that I do my interest, my faith, anything in Eastern has created just a community and a space for me to go and find people that are like me and just kind of expand my interest in those things.</p><p>&nbsp;</p>"
